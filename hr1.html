                Thank you for being born before me. I think you are sent before me to guide me, be with me and support me. I will always be there for you whenever you need me in the same way you are to me. Have great fun on this day. I know it sounds a bit cliche but love you my one and only exclusive alien. 
                Have a great day! I hope all your wishes come true.
            </p>
